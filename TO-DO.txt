1. Fragmentation and Reassembly: using scapy
add this to handle larger messages
we have to set a specific maximum size of packet (example 1025 bytes) 
and fragment accordingly
this is needed to send larger text messages and if we want to add file sending
capability (images/videos)

2. Sequence Numbers & packet acknowledgement: using scapy
add acknowledgement for recieved packets (on server and client side)
add sequence numbers to detect missing packets in order to retransmit

3. Error Detection: using scapy
add checksums to the ends of packets to detect transmission errors 
(packet got corrupted and some of the bits got changed while transmitting)

4. Authentication:
add authentication using passwords and tokens for security purposes

5. Encryption:
add encryption to each packet sent
